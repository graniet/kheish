## Kheish Compatibility

This skill is repo-local and stays inactive until explicitly activated.

When the original instructions refer to legacy tool names, use these Kheish mappings:

- `terminal` => `bash`
- `web_extract` => `web_fetch`, plus `web_search` when discovery is needed
- `search_files` => `grep_search` and `glob_search`
- `browser_*` tools require a browser-capable surfaced tool or MCP; if none is available, use the closest available surface and say so explicitly

When the instructions mention local helper files, resolve them from `${KHEISH_SKILL_DIR}`.
