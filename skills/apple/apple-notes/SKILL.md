## Kheish Compatibility

This skill is repo-local and stays inactive until explicitly activated.

When the original instructions refer to legacy tool names, use these Kheish mappings:

- `terminal` => `bash`
- `web_extract` => `web_fetch`, plus `web_search` when discovery is needed
- `search_files` => `grep_search` and `glob_search`
- `browser_*` tools require a browser-capable surfaced tool or MCP; if none is available, use the closest available surface and say so explicitly

When the instructions mention local helper files, resolve them from `${KHEISH_SKILL_DIR}`.

# Apple Notes

Use `memo` to manage Apple Notes directly from the terminal. Notes sync across all Apple devices via iCloud.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with Notes.app
- Install: `brew tap antoniorodr/memo && brew install antoniorodr/memo/memo`
- Grant Automation access to Notes.app when prompted (System Settings → Privacy → Automation)

## When to Use

- User asks to create, view, or search Apple Notes
- Saving information to Notes.app for cross-device access
- Organizing notes into folders
- Exporting notes to Markdown/HTML

## When NOT to Use

- Obsidian vault management → use the `obsidian` skill
- Bear Notes → separate app (not supported here)
- Quick agent-only notes → use the `memory` tool instead

## Quick Reference

### View Notes

```bash
memo notes                        # List all notes
memo notes -f "Folder Name"       # Filter by folder
memo notes -s "query"             # Search notes (fuzzy)
```

### Create Notes

```bash
memo notes -a                     # Interactive editor
memo notes -a "Note Title"        # Quick add with title
```

### Edit Notes

```bash
memo notes -e                     # Interactive selection to edit
```

### Delete Notes

```bash
memo notes -d                     # Interactive selection to delete
```

### Move Notes

```bash
memo notes -m                     # Move note to folder (interactive)
```

### Export Notes

```bash
memo notes -ex                    # Export to HTML/Markdown
```

## Limitations

- Cannot edit notes containing images or attachments
- Interactive prompts require terminal access (use pty=true if needed)
- macOS only — requires Apple Notes.app

## Rules

1. Prefer Apple Notes when user wants cross-device sync (iPhone/iPad/Mac)
2. Use the `memory` tool for agent-internal notes that don't need to sync
3. Use the `obsidian` skill for Markdown-native knowledge management
